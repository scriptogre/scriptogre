# Christian Tanul

I'm a full-stack developer with ~7 years of experience.

I build stuff: sometimes for clients, sometimes just to see if I can.

## Projects

#### htmx

Recreated the [htmx website](https://four.htmx.org), contributed the `<hx-partial>` tag and built-in SSE support.

#### hyper

Building a templating language that combines Python & HTML (+ type safety).

#### **roastroulette.io**

Built an [multiplayer party game](https://github.com/scriptogre/roast-roulette) (using htmx). Upload photos, get roasted by an LLM. 

Wanted something fun to play with the group during weekends.

Spits gems at times:

#### Homelab

I host a personal cloud: files, photos, calendar, DNS, media servers, etc.

I also self-host most of my projects.

Saves money. Taught me sysadmin stuff. Made me a NixOS convert.

### How I Work

Mostly alone.

[htmx](https://htmx.org/) over React, [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) over Nginx, [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) over classic VPNs. CSS over JS when possible.

I like turning complex things simple.
