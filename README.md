## About
Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm good at writing code, and not "about" sections.

I would've previously called myself a Python developer, but I suppose software developer is a more fitting now. I've extended my interest towards both the JavaScript realm and the Go land.

I'm a fan of underdog technologies such as HTMX & Svelte. I like getting stuff done quickly.

I've also become particularly good at building UI/UXs in TailwindCSS.

I teach web development live in my city. Check out https://lessons.tanulchristian.dev/

I try to provide free educational content from my journey as self-taught full-stack developer. Check out https://pyoneers.dev/

I do freelance projects, but I'm not really looking for a job - unless it's a perfect match.

## Hard Skills
* Python: Advanced proficiency (5 years experience in web development & automation).
* Django: Extensive experience (2-3 years), built several backend-intensive end-to-end projects by myself.
* JavaScript frameworks: Svelte, React, Alpine.JS, jQuery - worked with them, love some (Svelte) more than others (React). Would rather work with HTMX any day, though.
* Docker: I containerize one-off scripts. Enough said.
* Git: Obviously.
* Linux: Professional alias creator.

## Soft Skills
* Communication: Extroverted by default, easily becoming enthusiastic, difficult to shut up.
* Self-Management: Self-motivated & self-taught.
* Problem-solving: I seek solutions even when all my fiancee needs is for me to listen.
* Adaptability: A quick learner, able to adapt to new situations easily.
* Work Ethic: Can't go to sleep unless I've reached the mental milestone I proposed to myself.

## Interests
LLMs + prompt engineering, nutrition, fitness, psychology & biochemistry.
