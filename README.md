# Christian Tanul

I'm a full-stack developer with ~7 years of experience.

I build stuff. Sometimes for clients, sometimes for myself, sometimes just to see if I can.

I self-host most of my projects.

## Projects

#### htmx

Redesigned the [website](https://four.htmx.org), contributed the `<hx-partial>` tag and built-in SSE support.

#### **roastroulette.io**

Built an [open-source](https://github.com/scriptogre/roast-roulette) multiplayer party game. Upload photos, get roasted by an LLM. 

Built to play with my friends during weekends.

#### Homelab

I'm a home lab nerd with a personal cloud: files, photos, calendar, DNS, media servers, etc. 

Runs on several Synology NAS(es?), a ThinkCentre M90Q Gen 4, and a Raspberry Pi 5.

Saves money. Taught me sysadmin stuff. Made me a NixOS convert.

### How I Work

Mostly alone.

[htmx](https://htmx.org/) over React, [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) over Nginx, [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) over classic VPNs. CSS over JS when possible.

I like turning complex things simple.
