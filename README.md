# Christian Tanul

Hi, I'm Chris.

I've been doing full-stack development for 7 years.

I design & build web applications that often times serve ML or LLM models for different tasks. I also handle infrastructure & DevOps, managing self-hosted services and cloud deployments. 

I enjoy end-to-end ownership.

### Technical Philosophy

*complexity bad*

I gravitate toward simpler, overlooked technologies that solve problems elegantly.

I'll choose [htmx](https://htmx.org/) over React, [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) over Nginx, [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) over classic VPN servers, and CSS-only solutions over JavaScript, when they fit.

I focus obsessively on quality details. I've lost sleep over misaligned UI elements and unintuitive code architecture. This pushes me to constantly simplify and refactor.

Recently, I consolidated a web platform with 9 separate ML model servers into a single monolith, maintaining full functionality while reducing the codebase by ~80%. It felt nice.

I get energized by challenging myself to transform complex -> simple.

## Personal Projects

I run a homelab where I host my personal cloud: files, photos, calendar, contacts, along with DNS and media servers. 

I reduced ~$100/month worth of subscriptions, learned a lot about system administration, and learned to appreciate the independence and privacy you get from self-hosting.

It's a time sink, but I enjoy (most of) that time.

I also use it to self-host my publicly available projects:

#### **intreabalegea.ro**

<a href="https://intreabalegea.ro"><img width="800" alt="Intreaba Legea Landing Page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1094287c-7dc6-4ff0-a981-f325c48cd001" /></a>

One of these projects is [intreabalegea.ro](https://intreabalegea.ro), an LLM-powered web app that provides legal guidance for Romanians. 

What started as a personal project to learn Golang has grown into a team effort with 3 developers, which I continue to lead and maintain.

#### **roastroulette.io**

<a href="https://roastroulette.io"><img width="800" alt="Roast Roulette Landing Page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30069578-866a-4e48-a82a-78af0436ff63" /></a>

Another project is [roastroulette.io](https://roastroulette.io), an [open-source](https://github.com/scriptogre/roast-roulette) party game where players upload photos to get roasted by an LLM. 

I built this in a week during vacation because I wanted something fun to play with friends on weekends. 

Some of the roasts are corny, but it also spits gems at times:

*Note: Still in development, expect bugs.*

## Speaking & Community


### Workshop @ DjangoCon 2024: Functional Chatbots

Presented a workshop on connecting LLMs to web applications. 

The workshop repository includes 2 months of preparation with multiple checkpoint branches and detailed instructions.

- **Repository**: [github.com/scriptogre/functional-chatbots](http://github.com/scriptogre/functional-chatbots)

Presented how easily you can prototype a functional UI, even as a non-developer, using ChatGPT and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).


### Lightning Talk @ DjangoCon 2025: Roast Roulette Live Demo

<img width="400" alt="DjangoCon 2025 Lightning Talk" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f13c8d1-e6a6-4f48-8c7d-260b0fac31a2" />

Played a game of Roast Roulette with 70 members from the audience.

The game's first public debut.


## Beyond Code

While tech dominates my life, I do occasionally touch grass. 

Here are some quick facts about me:
- I've been (happily) married for **1 year**
- My longest water fast was **6 days**
- I can talk about nutrition for **3 hours** straight
- I find the **Big Five Aspects** fascinating
- I'm obsessed with an old & forgotten subgenre called **Intelligent Drum & Bass** (recently bought intelligentdnb.uk domain, still planning what to build)

If it is technically feasible for a bunch of evolved monkeys to eventually create Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)... 

Then the reality of a higher intelligence (**God**) is beyond question for me.
